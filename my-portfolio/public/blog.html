        <h1> My Lambda Experience</h1>

        <h2> Why I chose Lambda <h2>
        <p>
            It all started with me working in the field of pharmacology. Loving my job, loving my coworkers, and really looking forward to coming to work each and every day. My brother had lost his job and was having a hard time figuring out what he wanted to do with his career. My brother in law, has been studying code for several years at the community college and was getting ready for a job when he discovered Lambda School. He told my brother about this school and all the perks and benefits of what being a Software Engineer means. It means a 6 figure income, financial freedom, work from home opportunities, traveling, understanding the future technologies, job security, and the list goes on and on. My brother decided he would go for it. Never knew a single thing about code, and just jumped in head first. He applied and was accepted upon completion of the Lambda Challenge. After spending 8 straight hours with no breaks trying to pass, he did it!</p>
        <p> 
            My brother in law was so excited for him, and decided he would love the review and wanted to make sure what he learned in community college really was the most up to date information, so he applied to Lambda as well and he was in! 
        </p>
        <p> 
            My sister called me up on day and told me how she wants to take her two children and husband to Japan for a year and wants me to come with. I explained to her that I have a really great job, but I can't afford to just travel on a whim like that. She encouraged me to look into code and being a developer. She told me over and over again "All you need to succeed is the drive to want to learn". I told her I loved my job and I did not want to leave. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Within 2 weeks of this, over 200 people at my company were laid off. They started automating a lot of our processes and said over the next year another 400 people would lose their jobs. I called my sister and decided I would consider it.

        <p>
            I did a few follow along videos on youtube of HTML and CSS. It was fun and exciting to see my webpages fall into place. I decided it wasn't financially possible for me to quit my job and be a full time student like my family members did, but I would study and give it my all in the part time cohort. My brother was already through the first chunk of school, spoke <strong>SO HIGHLY</strong> of Lambda and was even hired on as a team lead. I felt word of mouth was the best advertising and I trusted him, so I did not research schools. I applied and got in! Looking back, this was my first big mistake.
        </p>
        <h2> My Actual Lambda Experience<h2>
            <p>
             I started off in the part time cohort (WEBPT7), where every other lecture was cancelled due to "technical difficulties" with zoom, or the instructor couldn't come (his wife had a migraine), his internet went out, or this happened, or that.. At the end of the day, I don't care. It is not my job to make sure the school is fully staffed. It is my job to show up ready to learn and try my best. After it was announced Cameron Pope (our teacher) had a stroke, I felt horrible. Being in the medical field, I understand exactly what happened medically and it's awful. However, I need to be in charge of my own learning, so I decided to switch to the full time cohort where I would get the lectures I needed and not be shuffled through.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since deciding that I would give Lambda my all. I quit my job, moved back in with my mom, and have been living VERY minimally off my savings (like 10 dollars a week in food) and switched to the full time cohort. I was not expecting to do this, so I had not saved up nearly enough to cover my monthly basics (car payments and insurance). While the full time cohort was about 2 lectures ahead of where I was at the time, I asked If I could join it starting the following week and do the lectures and work over the weekend (so I could finish by November when my savings ran out) and I was told no. You have to wait an entire month to start with the next cohort and start completely over. This meant I had to repeat the first 3 sprints and build week. I was incrdibly annoyed, but I understand Lambda has a process. I was told by the Head of Admissions that the full time cohort would end mid January. This was pretty un-doable because I didn't expect to join the full time cohort and quit my job. I expected to be working through the Lambda experience. I was lucky enough my sister said she would pay my bills for me through January if I needed it as this was important and her husband is an endorsed Lambda student with an amazing experience and really stands by the school. After having several family members go through Lambda, I knew it worked. I said okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            About 2 months later when the curriculum updated, we had a meeting with someone who was going over the updates in the curriculum and sublty mentioned, "dont worry, the end date did not change. It will still be the end of March". MARCH!? No one said anything about March when I switched from part time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided Lambda is very feedback forward and wants to hear from its students. So much that it is mandatory to leave feedback daily. I finally filled out true, honest feedback about my experience, what I felt and how their actions came across AND 2 or 3 DIFFERENT solutions. I wanted to give lots of ideas that they could bounce around. My full time TL (Team Lead: the person who grades your projects, answers your questions, and is your number one go to person in the program) was not very easy to talk to in terms of asking questions, as he never knew the answers or he would make something up or tell you to look it up. I mentioned all of this to my old part time TL who said he had never heard of something so terrible and passed it up the chain. A few days later he followed up saying someone from Student success named Stephanie would reach out to me and she is sweet and I should talk to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            Student Affairs (not Student Success) reached out instead, and told me after going through my feedback, I could get a Living stipend AFTER I finished computer science (in January) and to fill out the application. But thats just it. It's an application. Not a promise or anything I can budget around as an official income. I filled out the application before going full time and did not get it (although my situation was very different then).  He asked if we could chat in a zoom instead of across slack, I said okay. Over the zoom call the student affairs man told me that he had a background in psychology and he thinks I am depressed and I need mental health help. That Lambda school is stressful and my concerns weren't anything about the school but only money. My concerns were that I needed a new TL who I could talk to and ask questions to, and that I wasn't understanding the materials, I asked for TL hours (which is extra support that you can't sign yourself up for, only your team lead can sign you up), I was rarely signed up for them if ever, the money thing was part of it because I was lied to about the end date by 2 months! He then continued to tell me that if money is tight, I should apply to be a TL and that he is very closely connected with student success, who is the team that is in charge of hirings. He said if I let him know he would make sure it gets reviewed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I applied. Not only did I not get the job, but I didn't even get an interview. I keep hearing how they are so desperate for TL's, all of my friends in the cohort had interviews before being weeded out, and seeing as though I went through the information twice from part time and full time, I have a GOOD grasp on this stuff. I used to be a teacher before going to Lambda, and feel I have so much to offer. I am not having the great Lambda experience the way my family did, but I feel I can make a positive change for the future students. Unfortunatly, it is not good enough for Lambda because I am "depressed" and have "deep anxiety" per Student Affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            No. No sir. I am not depressed. I am actually quiet happy and excited to get a job working at Petsmart as a Java developer! Where I can bring my dog to work with me every day! I am frustrated being shuffled around and not taken seriously. He had me questioning my own sanity for WEEKS until I actually went to a psychiatrist which was more money out of pocket. For her to tell me, I am fine and don't have any of these disorders that Student Affairs told me I had. (he listed off a few).
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I googled him for quiet a bit to find out he has zero background in psychology and really has no place to be telling me that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have seen family go through this school and come out very successful and educated. I understand making this drastic of a life change is hard, and I get that you have to give it your ALL.... but at what point can you draw the line that your fed up and <strong> SO OVER </strong> the lack of communication, consistency - everyone has a different answer for everything, and professionalism throughout this organization.
        <p>
        </p>
            I was also provided an option for my cohort WEB21 that Lambda acknowledged the unhappiness with the program and mistakes within my cohort and offered students to walk away ISA contract free. While it truely is amazing the school is willing to accpet their mistakes, after quitting my job, moving in with my family, and relying on my sister's financial help, I am appalled that quitting is their solution. The school that claims all you need is to be dedicated, has a solution to just walk away!? I have been so dedicated and really giving it my ALL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I reached out once during a build week to the help channel, where you are supposed to go for help and was told by the TL assisting me that I wasnt allowed to send a direct message to her of images of my code. That all communication must be public for other students (which I dont feel comfortable with). Then she zoomed (video chat) with me and when I asked a question about an error message I was recieving she rolled her eyes at me, asked if I even attended the lectures and told me how I should already know the answer and she will not be helping me.
        </p>
        <p>
            OBVIOUSLY I attend lectures. Every day. Obviously, it is not helping me, which is why I am reaching out! To feel so small by someone who is HIRED to help you is a terrible feeling. To be belittled by student affairs, who is in place to help you become successful just makes you feel like pure dog shit.
        </p>
        <p>
            While being here my full time TL decided to join back in at Labs, and I was given a new TL. This is now my 3rd person (out of 7) I am being pushed around too when typically a student will have the same team lead the entire program. My new TL couldn't answer any questions and ultimately lead me to get a tutor outside of lambda as the help here has really failed me. I need to understand this stuff in order to be able to use critical thinking and be effective at my job once I am outside of Lambda. I understand certain lines of code go above others, and I can code out a fully functioning application because of it, but that doesn't mean I understand in a way that is going to help me critical think through problems in the work place. I asked this TL if I could please flex (a program Lambda school offers to students who don't understand the material to get a second look at it before moving on) because my understanding of redux was not there. At all. And technically I should not have passed build week because I did not use context api's or Redux in my code as the assignment required. He told me no. He said I passed the build week and sprint challenges and there is no reason to flex. My asking to flex is a confidence problem and that will be solved with time. I am irritated that I don't get a say in my own understanding or my own future. I am now buying Udemy courses and a private tutor spending more money I dont have to get through the program. If I knew all this going into it, I never would have applied for Lambda School. I know being a software engineer is worth it, and I am busting my behind, but only sleeping 2-3 hours a night because I am learning Java (a complete new language and backend at that) all day and redux all night is not working for me.

            This school also highly encourages neworking, collaboration, and face to face contact. So much that they are willing to pay up to $25 dollars per student for dinner once a month at our meet ups! This is where all the people from your state, can gather the first weekend of the month and have dinner, fellowship, network, and be social. Knowing the November meet up wasn't until the middle of the month, November 16th, I waited until a week and a half before the meet up to RSVP as it was too far out for me to plan otherwise. When I went to RSVP, I was told the RSVP was closed and I can not attend, I have to wait until the December meet up. For a school that wants to be so inclusive, they really are pro at making you feel excluded. My friend who did RSVP in time is also a vegan (as I myself am as well) and was told that this month, with the new meet up coordinator instead of picking a resturant and everyone ordering a menu item as they did in the past, they are going to a mexican resturant and having the chef make a pre-determined meal for everyone. When asked if there was a vegan option they were told no but the meat eaters would be happy to pick out the veggie sides and trade for the meat tacos. This doesn't feel like a very inclusive school or accomadating to anyones dietary restrictions. When brought up with the meet up coordinator I was told if I don't like it, don't go. I now feel targeted and excluded because of my love for animals and choice to not eat them and because I needed to wait until 13 days before the meet up to know if it was possible for me to attend. I don't understand how that is not enough time to "plan".</p>
        <p>
            Now, I do want to say --
            Not everything has been bad, and I do want to shine light. The VERY first contact I had here at Lambda was my TL from the part time cohort I was in. He and I still talk daily and he has become the best tutor, mentor, friend I have ever met. He has been the one encouraging me to put up with student affairs and not quit Lambda. And there is another student, who I met on day one of full time WEB21 who has been encouraging, struggeling along with me, motivating, pulling all nighters next to me, and keeping a fire under me.  If there is any reason at all that I have made it as far as I have, it's because those two people never gave up on me the way the school did.
        </p>
    <h2> What I learned?</h2>
        <p> 
            It is very easy to blame the school for my failures as they failed our entire class. However, I am the one to blame here. I did not do enough research on this school, reading blogs about other students expereiences, or fully understand the end dates/budgets, and what I needed to be successfull in this school. I have learned that your Lambda experience is 100% dependant on who is your assigned team lead, how much they care and the drive they have to learn and want help, and how many hours you are willing to put into the school. They say the school is from 8 am-5 pm, however that is not true. If you need help, or your TL decides you need help (even if you feel you understand the information) you are required to attend before hours, after hours help AND TL hours. Which if you are doing both is 6am - 9pm. with a 1 hour lunch from 11-12. It is exhausting and you only hope you are good enough to land a job by the end of it.
        </p>

        <p> 
            In conclusion, I have not given up on myself or the school, but this has been an eye opening experience to say the least. I only hope future students can gain some insight from my experience in hopes to better shape theirs.
